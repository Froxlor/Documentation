# Resources

As admin or reseller, you can manage resources. In other words, the IP addresses, MySQL servers, domains and of course your customers.

## Basics

After the installation, froxlor should have automatically created **IP address entries** for you. Depending on your selection in the installation process, one for standard **HTTP port 80** and one **ssl enabled** for standard **HTTPS port 443**.

If your server has additional IP addresses, e.g. **IPv6**, it is wise to add them all in froxlor. You can easily set one or more as system default in the [settings](../settings), these will be pre-selected when adding a new domain for example.

For more details see [IPs and ports](ips-and-ports).

You can now start to add your first customers. Fill out account and contact data accordingly, set desired service-resources and click _Save_. A customer is required in order to be able to add domains, as they are always connected to a customer.

For more details see [Customers](customers) and if you plan on having resellers to manage their own customers and domains, see [Admins / Resellers](admins-resellers).
