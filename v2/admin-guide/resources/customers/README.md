# Customers

## 1. General

## 2. Locked and deactivated states

There are two states a customer can be in that limit/restrict actions available. The main difference is that the **locked** state, which occurs e.g. after multiple failed logins, does not affect the customers web-, email- or ftp availability. A **locked customer** needs to either be unlocked manually by an admin/reseller or wait for the specified _Deactivation Time_ (in _Settings  Â» Account settings_) for the account to get unlocked automatically.

Admins/Reseller can **deactivate** customers. This state will disable all availability of websites, email-accounts, etc. for the customer and does not allow any login. It can only be manually reactivated by a corresponding admin/reseller.
